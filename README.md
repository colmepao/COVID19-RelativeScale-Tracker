# COVID19-RelativeScale-Tracker
  Purpose:
Application for comparing the impact of COVID19 on selected counties and regions of the US, side-by-side for a broader perspective of how the US has handled the pandemic. Additionally, the applications functions to compare side-by-side two implementations of the task, which are centered around two different data structures: m-ary trees and hashtables.

  Declarations:
Code from foundation/inspiration project, a group assignment from COP3530 at UF, is reused and improved upon. See https://github.com/colmepao/COVIDTracker for original.

  Goals (as of 9/16/20):
1) Update hashtable implementation to take in data from any date range; not just the restricted range selected for the original project (March-July)
2) If m-ary tree implementation is too difficult to adapt to this - being the original reason for limiting the date range - then construct my own version of the m-ary implementation (most likely scenario).
3) Integrate other stats as originally intended
    a) pneumonia and flu-related deaths since start of the pandemic in comparison to past 5-year average
    b) severity-score, which is a number relative to a moving national-average 
4) Translation to a web-based app, with GUI, that updates automatically/periodically.
